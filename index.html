    <h2>Our Policies</h2>
    <h3>1. Warranty Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Standard Warranty:</strong> Luxury watches typically come with a 2-5 year warranty covering defects in materials or workmanship. The warranty is generally valid from the date of purchase.</p>
    <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Warranty typically doesnâ€™t cover damage due to wear and tear, accidents, unauthorized repairs, or water damage (unless the watch is water-resistant to a certain depth).</p>
    <p><strong>Service Centers:</strong> Warranty services must be done at authorized service centers to maintain authenticity and preserve the warranty.</p>

    <h3>2. Return and Exchange Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Time Frame:</strong> Some luxury watch brands offer a 14 to 30-day return or exchange window, while others may not accept returns. However, the item must be unused and in its original condition and packaging.</p>
    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Returns and exchanges might only be allowed for defective products. Certain brands have a strict no-return policy unless the watch is faulty or damaged.</p>
    <p><strong>Restocking Fees:</strong> Certain brands may impose a restocking fee on returns of luxury watches, especially after the watch has been sized or engraved.</p>

    <h3>3. Authenticity and Certification</h3>
    <p><strong>Authenticity Certificate:</strong> Upon purchase, luxury watches usually come with a certificate of authenticity, guaranteeing the watch is genuine.</p>
    <p><strong>Serial Number:</strong> Each luxury watch will have a unique serial number that can be used to verify its authenticity. Brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Omega have their own verification systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Authorized Dealers:</strong> Always buy from authorized dealers to ensure the watch is genuine and comes with full brand support.</p>

    <h3>4. Pricing and Payment Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> Luxury watch brands usually set a recommended retail price (RRP), and any authorized dealer should adhere to it. However, the price may vary depending on taxes, import duties, and location.</p>
    <p><strong>Custom Duties and Taxes:</strong> When purchasing luxury watches in India, be aware of import duties (typically 30-35% on luxury items), GST, and other taxes that could increase the final price.</p>
    <p><strong>Financing Options:</strong> Some luxury brands may offer financing or EMI options, especially for high-value items, making it easier for customers to purchase watches over time.</p>

    <h3>5. Customization Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Engraving and Personalization:</strong> Many luxury watch brands offer engraving services for personalization, often at an additional cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Customization Limits:</strong> Customizations are usually limited to the watch face, strap materials, and engraving. However, extensive custom modifications are often not allowed under the brandâ€™s guidelines to maintain brand identity and value.</p>

    <h3>6. Repair and Maintenance Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Authorized Service Centers:</strong> For any repairs or servicing, itâ€™s essential to visit authorized service centers. Using non-authorized services can void the warranty.</p>
    <p><strong>Servicing Frequency:</strong> Luxury watches should ideally be serviced every 3-5 years, depending on the brand and type (e.g., mechanical vs. quartz).</p>
    <p><strong>Parts Replacement:</strong> Original parts should be used for repairs and servicing to maintain the watch's integrity and value.</p>

    <h3>7. Security and Insurance Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Insurance:</strong> Some luxury watch owners choose to insure their timepieces, especially high-value pieces. Insurance covers theft, loss, or accidental damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage and Care:</strong> Luxury watches should be stored in safe places (preferably in a watch box with proper humidity and temperature control). Watch winders are also used for automatic watches to keep them running smoothly.</p>

    <h3>8. Delivery and Shipping Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>International Shipping:</strong> Luxury watch brands often ship globally, but shipping can be expensive due to insurance costs, especially for high-value watches.</p>
    <p><strong>Packaging:</strong> Watches will be shipped with premium packaging, including branded boxes and certificates, to preserve their value.</p>
    <p><strong>Delivery Timelines:</strong> Delivery timelines for luxury watches, especially if they are customized or limited edition, can take several weeks or even months.</p>

    <h3>9. Customer Support Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>After-Sales Service:</strong> Brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and others have dedicated customer service teams for handling inquiries, complaints, or servicing.</p>
    <p><strong>Online Support:</strong> Many luxury watch brands now offer online chat support or phone support to answer customer queries regarding their purchases, warranties, or services.</p>
    <p><strong>International Support:</strong> For customers who travel, many luxury watch brands offer international support, meaning your warranty is valid across different countries.</p>

    <h3>10. Resale Policy (Secondary Market)</h3>
    <p><strong>Authorized Resale:</strong> Some luxury brands, such as Rolex, do not officially support the resale of their watches. However, watches from reputable sources like authorized retailers or certified pre-owned sellers maintain their authenticity.</p>
    <p><strong>Value Retention:</strong> Luxury watches can often appreciate in value, particularly limited-edition models or vintage pieces. Customers may choose to sell or trade their watches, often through established auction houses or secondary market dealers.</p>
    <p><strong>Pre-Owned Watches:</strong> Many luxury brands have started offering pre-owned watches with certified authenticity and warranty, ensuring that buyers get reliable pieces even in the secondary market.</p>
